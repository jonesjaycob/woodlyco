This technique involves cutting a projection (tenon) on one piece of wood to fit precisely into a hole (mortise) in another piece.\n\nUnlike nails or screws that can loosen over time, mortise and tenon joints actually get stronger as the wood seasons and tightens around the joint.\n\n## Why It Matters for Your Light Post\n\nOur 11×11 inch timber posts are built using these same traditional methods. Here's why that matters:\n\n- **No metal fasteners to rust** — The joint itself holds everything together\n- **Natural flexibility** — Wood expands and contracts with seasons; the joint moves with it\n- **Repairable** — If damage ever occurs, traditional joinery can be restored\n\n## Built for Alabama Weather\n\nFrom summer heat to winter storms, our posts are finished with UV-resistant protective coatings that work with the natural durability of the timber frame construction.\n\nInterested in seeing our joinery up close?
