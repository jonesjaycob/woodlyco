      "content": "When you invest in a Woodly Co. light post, you're not just buying outdoor lighting — you're investing in a piece of craftsmanship that will outlast most modern construction.\n\n## The Secret: Mortise and Tenon Joinery\n\nFor thousands of years, master craftsmen have used mortise and tenon joints to create structures that last centuries. This technique involves cutting a projection (tenon) on one piece of wood to fit precisely into a hole (mortise) in another piece.\n\nUnlike nails or screws that can loosen over time, mortise and tenon joints actually get stronger as the wood seasons and tightens around the joint.\n\n## Why It Matters for Your Light Post\n\nOur 11×11 inch timber posts are built using these same traditional methods. Here's why that matters:\n\n- **No metal fasteners to rust** — The joint itself holds everything together\n- **Natural flexibility** — Wood expands and contracts with seasons; the joint moves with it\n- **Repairable** — If damage ever occurs, traditional joinery can be restored\n\n## Built for Alabama Weather\n\nFrom summer heat to winter storms, our posts are finished with UV-resistant protective coatings that work with the natural durability of the timber frame construction.\n\nInterested in seeing our joinery up close?

      "content": "One of the most common questions we hear from customers is: *\"Which power option should I choose?\"* The answer depends on your property, your preferences, and how you plan to use your light post. Let's break it down.\n\n## Solar-Powered Light Posts\n\n**Best for:** Driveways, garden paths, and anywhere electrical access is limited.\n\nSolar-powered posts harness Alabama's abundant sunshine to charge during the day and illuminate your property at night. No trenching, no electrician, no ongoing energy costs.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Zero operating cost after installation\n- No wiring required — install anywhere with sun exposure\n- Environmentally friendly\n- Automatic dusk-to-dawn operation\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Requires 4-6 hours of direct sunlight daily\n- Light output may vary in cloudy weather\n- Battery replacement every 3-5 years\n\n## Battery-Powered Light Posts\n\n**Best for:** Shaded areas, temporary installations, or locations where you want full control over timing.\n\nBattery-powered posts give you flexibility without the need for sun or electrical infrastructure. Simply swap or recharge batteries as needed.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Works in shaded locations\n- Portable — can be relocated easily\n- No wiring or solar panel positioning required\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Requires periodic battery changes or recharging\n- Higher long-term operating cost than solar\n- Best suited for accent lighting rather than primary illumination\n\n## Hardwired Electric Light Posts\n\n**Best for:** Primary lighting, security applications, or when you want maximum brightness and reliability.\n\nTraditional hardwired posts connect to your home's electrical system, delivering consistent, powerful illumination night after night.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Brightest, most consistent light output\n- No batteries to change or solar panels to position\n- Can integrate with smart home systems and timers\n- Ideal for security lighting\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Requires professional electrical installation\n- Ongoing energy costs (though LED fixtures minimize this)\n- Less flexibility in placement\n\n## Our Recommendation\n\nFor most Alabama homeowners, we recommend **solar-powered posts** as the primary choice — our sunshine is reliable, and the installation savings are significant. For heavily shaded properties or security-focused applications, **hardwired electric** delivers the best performance.\n\nNot sure which is right for your property? [Contact us for a free consultation](/contact) — we're happy to visit your site and recommend the perfect solution.\n\n---\n\n*Every Woodly light post is handcrafted using traditional timber frame joinery, regardless of which power option you choose. The craftsmanship stays the same — only the technology inside changes.*"
